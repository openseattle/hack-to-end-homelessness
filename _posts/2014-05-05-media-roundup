Thanks again to all our amazing participants for the inspiring work you did this weekend. We are working to get <i>all</i> the projects showcased on the home page, but in the meantime, we thought you would enjoy seeing media coverage from this weekend. It's not all 100 percent accurate, but hey - together, we got the word out about homelessness, inspired people to take action, and built some really cool stuff.
