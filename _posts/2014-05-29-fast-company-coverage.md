As many of our teams continue their important work together, their projects are getting well-deserved coverage in major outlets. It turns out, national media are as motivated to understand, demystify, and solve homelessness as we are! 

Today, Fast Company published a second article related to our event, "<a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3030363/visualized/mapping-americas-homelessness-problem-visualizes-the-extent-of-an-often-invisible">Mapping America's Homelessness Problem Visualizes The Extent Of An Often Invisible Problem</a>," by Ben Schiller. This piece showcases the work of the Committee to End Homelessness-King County's team and also discusses the local maps made by team Maptastics and team We Count. Earlier, Ben wrote about Mark Horvath's We Are Visible app in "<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/person/mark-hovarth">A Peer-to-Peer Network Connects The Homeless to The Rest of The World"</a>.

Congratulations again to all our teams! Your work continues to inspire and motivate people around the world.
